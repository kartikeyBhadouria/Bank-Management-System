# Bank-Management-System

The "Bank Management System" project is a Java-based application that simulates an ATM and provides internet banking functionality. It allows customers to perform basic banking transactions such as account opening, deposit, withdrawal, mini-statements, and pin change.

The project utilizes Java technologies such as Swing and AWT for building the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL as the database management system. It provides customers with the convenience of accessing their account details, performing transactions, and viewing reports from the comfort of their homes or offices through a PC or laptop.

The system follows a modular approach, enabling future expansion and modification to meet the evolving needs of the banking sector. It embraces the concept of virtual banking, transforming traditional brick-and-mortar banking into a click-and-portal model, making banking transactions accessible globally round the clock.
